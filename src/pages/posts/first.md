# 1st: Speed
[Cloudflare pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) is running with V8 runtime. It makes the developement harder because API aren't the same than node js and some packages aren't available. But it makes the website faster. It's a tradeoff that I'm willing to make. The website is host on Cloudflare's global network, like Vercel or Netlify.

# 2nd: Global Cloudflare experience
Cloudflare also helps you to manage your domain dns and ssl certificate. It's a great experience to have everything in one place. The dashboard is complete and not overwhelming. Cloudflare also have a lot of optimization that you can enable with one click.

# 3rd: Free
Cloudflare pages is free. You can have up to 1000 builds per month. It's more than enough for a personal blog. You can also have a custom domain. It's a great deal.
